Salary prediction using simple linear regression and integration with flask.


This is very simple salary prediction, this is just to get hands on experience on basic **linear regession** and its integartion with **flask** and **postman**.

Here, the Dataset is **Salary_Data.csv**

1. **model.py** : This file has the code for building the model and it is saved into the **model.pkl.**
2. **app.py** : This file contains the code for integration with the flask.

The input data to the model is the experience, which is sent in the form of **POST Request** for which **POSTMAN** is used.
